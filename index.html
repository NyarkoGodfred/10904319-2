              <h1> MY PERSONAL INFORMATION</h1>
              <h2> INTRODUCTION ABOUT MYSELF! </h2>
              <p>My name is <b><i>Nyarko Godfred</i></b> a student in University of Ghana (<span class="capit">legon</span>) reading Bachelor of Science in Information Technology. One of my ambition in life is to become one of the best programmers in the world specifically to my motherland Ghana. I heal from Abuakwa in the Ashanti Region and the game i like best is football. The food i like the most is Banku with Okro stew. </p>
       
              <p> I am passionate about my work because, I love what i do, I have a steady source of moltivation that drives me to do my best. In my first project i was asked to use html to write about myself so that will get to know how to use the html skills very well and it has helped me use some of the tools in styling my assignment. More atimes I used the notepad to try my hands on the use of the html when there is no assignment and it has helped me very well.</p>
